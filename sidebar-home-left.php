     <h3>About</h3>
	 <p>I have been drawing and designing for the last 2 years. I love all sorts of styles, and I refuse to stick to just any particular category. I love recreating a certain drawing, or coming up with something original. I love working closely with people to produce quality work, and a piece art that you can enjoy. I have a large library of work I've already done, and I am constantly working on improving. I believe we are always learning, and ever growing. I hope to talk to you soon about your next wall painting, or tattoo idea!<p>
